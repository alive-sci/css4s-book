## Section 1: Simple social learning dynamics

We begin with a minimal example to illustrate how the `socmod` package represents agent-based learning dynamics. The focal agent (Agent 1) interacts with neighbors exhibiting either adaptive or legacy behaviors. Behavior adoption is determined by comparing fitness, and agents update based on a success-bias strategy.

```{r}
library(socmod)
library(igraph)
library(dplyr)
library(tibble)
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
# Define a toy ABM for learning
make_example_learning_abm <- function() {
  agent_1 <- Agent$new(1, behavior = "Legacy", fitness = 1, name = "1")
  agent_2 <- Agent$new(2, behavior = "Adaptive", fitness = 4, name = "2")
  agent_3 <- Agent$new(3, behavior = "Legacy", fitness = 1, name = "3")
  agent_4 <- Agent$new(4, behavior = "Legacy", fitness = 2, name = "4")

  agents <- list(agent_1, agent_2, agent_3, agent_4)
  socnet <- make_graph(~ 1-2, 1-3, 1-4, 3-2)
  abm <- AgentBasedModel$new(agents = agents, graph = socnet)
  return(abm)
}
```

```{r}
# Run a single success-biased trial
abm <- make_example_learning_abm()

trial <- run_trial(
  abm,
  partner_selection = success_bias_select_teacher,
  interaction = success_bias_interact,
  iterate = iterate_learning_model,
  stop = 10
)

# Show observation and outcome tables
observations <- as_tibble(trial$get_observations())
outcomes <- as_tibble(trial$get_outcomes())

print(observations)
print(outcomes)
```

```{r}
# Plot behavior change over time
ggplot(observations, aes(x = time, y = behavior, group = agent, color = agent)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  labs(title = "Observations: Behavior Over Time", x = "Time Step", y = "Behavior") +
  theme_minimal()
```



Now we explore how **learning strategy** and **adaptive fitness** affect behavior change by running trials over combinations of both.

```{r}
# Define strategies
strategies <- list(
  success = list(
    partner_selection = success_bias_select_teacher,
    interaction = success_bias_interact
  ),
  frequency = list(
    partner_selection = frequency_bias_select_teacher,
    interaction = frequency_bias_interact
  )
)
```

```{r}
# Run trials across fitness levels and strategies
param_grid <- tidyr::crossing(
  f_A = c(2, 4, 6, 8),
  strategy = names(strategies)
)

results <- param_grid |>
  mutate(trials = purrr::pmap(list(f_A, strategy), function(f_A, strategy) {
    run_trials(
      n = 25,
      model_generator = make_example_learning_abm,
      partner_selection = strategies[[strategy]]$partner_selection,
      interaction = strategies[[strategy]]$interaction,
      iterate = iterate_learning_model,
      stop = 10,
      fitness_override = list("Adaptive" = f_A),
      metadata = list(f_A = f_A, strategy = strategy)
    )
  })) |>
  tidyr::unnest(trials)
```

```{r}
# Summarize results by metadata
summary_df <- summarise_by_metadata(results)

ggplot(summary_df, aes(x = f_A, y = proportion, color = strategy)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~behavior) +
  labs(
    title = "Behavior Adoption by Fitness and Learning Strategy",
    x = "Adaptive Fitness (f_A)", y = "Proportion Adopting"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```
## Section 2: Diffusion in the Florentine marriage network

To explore how seed set and fitness affect the success of an adaptation, we use a historical social network — the Florentine marriage network among elite families in Renaissance Italy.

We compare how two different seed sets — `Medici + Pazzi` vs. `Medici + Strozzi` — influence the success of an adaptive behavior under varying fitness advantages.

```{r}
# Load required packages
library(socmod)
library(dplyr)
library(purrr)
library(igraph)
library(ggplot2)

# Load the Florentine marriage network
load_florentine_marriage_network <- function() {
  if (!requireNamespace("netrankr", quietly = TRUE)) {
    stop("Please install the 'netrankr' package to access the Florentine families network.")
  }

  data("florentine_m", package = "netrankr", envir = environment())
  graph <- igraph::delete_vertices(florentine_m, which(degree(florentine_m) == 0))
  return(graph)
}

# Define the agent-based model for given seed set and fitness
make_florentine_seed_model <- function(seed_families = c("Medici"),
                                       adaptive_fitness = 1.2,
                                       legacy_fitness = 1,
                                       graph = NULL) {
  if (is.null(graph)) {
    if (!requireNamespace("netrankr", quietly = TRUE)) {
      stop("Please install the 'netrankr' package to access the Florentine families network.")
    }
    data("florentine_m", package = "netrankr", envir = environment())
    graph <- igraph::delete_vertices(florentine_m, which(degree(florentine_m) == 0))
  }

  nodes <- igraph::V(graph)$name

  agents <- purrr::map(nodes, function(family) {
    behavior <- if (family %in% seed_families) "Adaptive" else "Legacy"
    fitness <- if (behavior == "Adaptive") adaptive_fitness else legacy_fitness
    Agent$new(id = family, name = family, behavior = behavior, fitness = fitness)
  })

  AgentBasedModel$new(agents = agents, graph = graph)
}

# Run trials for each seed set and adaptive fitness value
run_florentine_seed_model <- function(adaptive_fitnesses = c(1.0, 1.5),
                                      n_trials = 10,
                                      seed_sets = list(

                                        `Medici + Strozzi` = c("Medici", "Strozzi")
                                      ),
                                      legacy_fitness = 1) {

  trials <- purrr::map2(
    names(seed_sets), seed_sets,
    function(label, seeds) {
      purrr::map(adaptive_fitnesses, function(f_A) {

        )
      }) |> flatten()
    }
  ) |> flatten()

  summary_by_fitness <- summarise_by_metadata(
    trials, fields = c("adaptive_fitness", "seed_set")
  )

  return(summary_by_fitness)
}

# Plot results
plot_florentine_seed_analysis <- function(adaptive_fitnesses, summary_by_fitness) {
